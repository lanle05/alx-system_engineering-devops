Postmortem: Web Stack Outage on January 25, 2024

Issue Summary:

Duration: January 25, 2024, 15:00 - 18:30 (UTC)
Impact: The web application experienced downtime, rendering the service inaccessible for approximately 30% of users during the outage.
Root Cause: A misconfiguration in the load balancer settings resulted in improper distribution of incoming traffic, causing service disruptions.
Timeline:

15:00 (UTC): Issue detected through increased error rates and user reports of site unavailability.
15:10 (UTC): Monitoring alerts triggered for elevated error rates and server response time.
15:15 (UTC): Investigation initiated by the DevOps team to identify the root cause.
15:30 (UTC): Initial assumption of a server-side issue led to thorough examination of server logs and resource utilization.
16:00 (UTC): No conclusive findings; issue escalated to the Network Operations Center (NOC) for further analysis.
16:30 (UTC): Network engineers identified misconfiguration in load balancer settings causing uneven distribution of traffic.
17:00 (UTC): Load balancer settings corrected, and service started to recover.
18:30 (UTC): Full service restoration confirmed.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause: The misconfiguration in the load balancer resulted in uneven distribution of incoming traffic, causing some servers to be overloaded while others remained underutilized.
Resolution: The load balancer settings were corrected to evenly distribute incoming requests among the available servers. This ensured a balanced workload and prevented service degradation.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:

Automated Configuration Checks: Implement automated checks to verify the consistency of load balancer configurations, preventing similar misconfigurations in the future.
Enhanced Monitoring: Enhance monitoring systems to provide more granular insights into traffic distribution and server performance.
Documentation Review: Conduct a comprehensive review of load balancer documentation to ensure clear guidelines for configuration settings.
Tasks to Address the Issue:

Automate Load Balancer Configuration Checks: Develop scripts to regularly check and validate load balancer configurations against defined best practices.
Incident Response Training: Provide additional training to the DevOps team on incident response procedures and effective collaboration with other teams.
Load Testing: Conduct load testing scenarios to simulate and identify potential issues related to traffic distribution.
Regular Configuration Audits: Establish a schedule for regular audits of critical infrastructure components to identify and address potential misconfigurations.

This incident has provided valuable insights into the importance of robust monitoring, timely escalation, and thorough root cause analysis. By implementing the corrective and preventative measures outlined above, we aim to fortify our system against similar issues and enhance overall system reliability.
